We analyzed simulation results from dense and massive globular cluster models simulated using
MOCCA code. The goal was to create detailed histories of IMBH seed growth in clusters of varying
metalicities, initial binary fraction, half mass radius and Initial Mass Function (IMF). Each cluster
was simulated to Hubble Time. A series of python based automated scripts were developed to
analyze how IMBH seed was growing in simulations where IMBH formed through runaway
collisions of stars. The scripts were later assembled into MOCCA-BH-Forge (MOCCA-Blackhole-
Forge). MOCCA-BH-Forge is an open-source simulation data visualization pipeline, designed to
work with MOCCA output snapshots and history files. Currently, it can analyze and visualize events
leading to IMBH growth in simulated massive star clusters. It is also capable of creating data
subsets like gravitational wave candidates from MOCCA output interaction history files. Detailed
analysis of IMBH growth history was conducted using history files in MOCCA-BH-Forge. We
found 2756 mergers with main-sequence stars out of which 2635 were direct collisions. 182
mergers were found involving evolved stars, 1523 involving white dwarfs, 137 involving neutron
stars and 486 mergers involving stellar mass black holes. These collisions between MS stars,
evolved stars, compact objects and IMBH are likely to lead to tidal disruption events. We also found
hundreds of gravitational wave candidates with gravitational waves corresponding to the LISA
detection range. These candidates were extracted from MOCCA-Survey Database I (Askar et al.
2017) using MOCCA-BH-Forge.
