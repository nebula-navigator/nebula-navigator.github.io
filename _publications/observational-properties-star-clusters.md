MOCCA-BH-Forge is an automated is a python-based automated pipeline developed to analyze
output files from MOCCA simulations. Currently, the pipeline can analyze and visualize MOCCA
snapshots and history files. Here we describe how MOCCA-BH-Forge can be employed to project a
MOCCA snapshot and visualize distribution of various stellar types in a simulated globular cluster.
This can be useful to compare with real cluster observations to infer the presence and growth
dynamics of an IMBH. In addition, we present mock photometric observations of the cluster created
from a MOCCA snapshot file. The observations were generated by combining magnitudes and
simulated Point Spread Functions from JWST filters F070W, F090W, F277W and F444W with
stellar parameters from MOCCA snapshot. The results show astonishing resemblance with some
real globular clusters observed by JWST. The mock observations were developed in collaboration
with Paolo Bianchinni.
