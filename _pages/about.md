I am interested in developing new techniques and refining the current ones to analyze observational data from space
as well as ground based telescopes in order to maximize the yield of information from data based on our current
technological capabilities. With interests spanning exoplanet characterization, binary stars, black holes in globular
clusters, and fundamental questions like the <b>search for life beyond Earth</b>, I aim to develop tools that push observational
boundaries. As observational data grows, my goal is to leverage advanced techniques, including machine learning
and AI, to enhance data interpretation in these fields.I am particularly inspired by the potential of JWSTâ€™s high-resolution capabilities to
characterize Earth-like planets, and I look forward to contributing to this frontier research.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->
